AutoItScript - Syntax Package for Sublime Text 2/3
============

AutoItScript AU3 language package for SublimeText including syntax highlighting, comments toggling, snippets, build systems for run and compile, and Tidy command.

For the build systems and Tidy command, if you have a non-default installation you will need to set your specific path to AutoIt3.exe, Aut2Exe.exe, and Tidy.exe in a file named AutoIt.sublime-settings in your User folder. You can access these settings file from the Menu Preferences>Package Settings>AutoIt. You should make a copy of "AutoIt Settings - Default" at "AutoIt Settings - User" since then your settings file in your User folder will not get overwritten when this package updates.
